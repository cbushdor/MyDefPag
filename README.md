# Introduction

This script is intended to printout a nice default page if it is included/present in the current directory.

- ## RULE 1

If so, update(s) is/are made within sub-directorie(s)[^1]  present(s) in this directory.

- ## RULE 2

If you go within one of these sub-directorie(s) then, it becomes current directory and RULE 1 is applied and so on and so fourth!

- ## FILE README.POD

By default only README.pod[^3] is interpreted in the current directory[^2].

# Technical prerequisites

- It is needed to have script interpreter installed at server side.

- It is needed to install some more dependencies[^4]...
