=head1 Introduction

This script is intended to printout a nice default page if it is included/present in the current directory.

=head2 RULE 1

If so, update(s) is/are made within sub-directorie(s)[^1]  present(s) in this directory.

=head2 RULE 2

If you go within one of these sub-directorie(s) then, it becomes current directory and RULE 1 is applied and so on and so fourth!

=head2 FILE README.POD

By default only README.pod is interpreted in the current directory.  To write *.pod scripts go to (https://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod). scripting language. [^2].
