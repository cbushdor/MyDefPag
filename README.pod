=head1 Introduction

This script is intended to printout a nice default page if it is included/present in the current directory.

=over

=item * ## RULE 1

=back

If so, update(s) is/are made within sub-directorie(s)[^1]  present(s) in this directory.

=over

=item * ## RULE 2

=back

If you go within one of these sub-directorie(s) then, it becomes current directory and RULE 1 is applied and so on and so fourth!

=over

=item * ## FILE README.POD

=back

By default only README.pod[^3] is interpreted in the current directory[^2].

[^2]: Only one README.pod file per directory but that directory can have as many as *.pod file as you want!
